| 1     | System crash with possible data loss; the test object in this form is not able to run                                                                       | [[patch]]        | The work flow of an user is blocked or the running tests cannot be continued. The problem must be either solved immediately or provisionally |
| 2     | Important function is defective; Requirements are not observed or incorrectly implemented; the test object is only able to run with significant limitations | [[next version]] | The defect correction happens with the next regular product version or the next test object delivery                                         |
| 3     | Functional deviation or limitation ("normal" defect); requirements defective or only partially implemented; system can only be used with limitations        | [[occasionally]] | The defect correction happens, as soon as the affected part of the system is reworked anyway                                                 |
| 4     | Small deviation; System can be used without limitations                                                                                                     | [[open]]         | Correction planning has to be still done                                                                                                     |
