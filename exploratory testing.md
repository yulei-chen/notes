#testing 

Characteristics: informal testing where test design, execution, and learning about the product happen **simultaneously**.

Use [[test charter]] to guide a test session (usually 1-2 hours in an uninterrupted "closed working unit").

Strategies:
 - heuristics
 - user stories
 - interference (disturbing normal flow)
 - pairwise testing
