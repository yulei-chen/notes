### Analytic Approaches

- Based on analysis of risks
    
- Example: **Risk-based testing**
    
- Testing focuses on areas with the **highest defect risk**
    

---

### Model-based Approaches

- Tests are derived from **models** of the system
    
- Models can represent:
    
    - Functions
        
    - Internal structure
        
    - Business processes
        
    - Non-functional characteristics
        

---

### Methodological Approaches

- Systematic use of **predefined test sets or test conditions**
    
- Examples:
    
    - Quality characteristic lists
        
    - Website testing checklists
        
    - Look-and-feel standards for mobile apps
        
- **Defect-based testing (Error Guessing)**:
    
    - Experience-based
        
    - Uses checklists and known defect patterns

### Process- or Standard-compliant Approaches

- Tests are designed according to:
    
    - External regulations
        
    - Industry standards
        
    - Company-specific processes
        
- Important for regulated domains
    

---

### Consulting Approaches

- Testing is guided by:
    
    - Stakeholders
        
    - Technical experts
        
    - Business domain experts
        
- Experts are often **outside the test team**

### Test Reuse-oriented Approaches

- Reuse existing:
    
    - Test cases
        
    - Test environments
        
    - Test frameworks
        
- From previous projects or standard test sets
    
- Reduces cost and effort
